### Setting up VSCODE
While technically using vscode isn't necessary, it will make interacting with your linux acount a lot easier! 
* Go to the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Follow the instructions to download and install it on your computer. 

You should get something like this:


### SSH connect
Open a terminal in VScode. (Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal → New Terminal menu option).
In the terminal, enter the following, replacing the zz with your UCSD 
    $ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
  

After succesfully connecting, you should receive a message like this:
    ⤇ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
    The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
